            Electricity consumption <br>
For an equivalent service, the electricity consumption of servers can be reduced by choosing low-energy equipment.
<br> <br>
When deciding which server to buy, choose one with an 80Plus-certified power supply (Platinum or Titanium) and with an Energy Star certification. <br>
You can also choose an appropriate hardware architecture based on the web application in question. For example, physicalization is better suited for a high-traffic website. This involves using n very low-energy CPU instead of running n virtual machines on a physical server whose processor (e.g. Xeon) is often energy-intensive. <br>
